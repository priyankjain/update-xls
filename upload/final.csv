It's a carbon fiber tank, which is also called an scba tank, and has a high-pressure scba valve...like the one firefighters use on their scba tanks. Many dive shops do not have the ability to fill these tanks. In some towns, the fire department has a compressor that can fill a high-pressure carbon fiber tank, as firefighters use smaller scba tanks for breathing equipment during rescues.  You might want to approach your local fire department and ask if they would be willing to fill your high-pressure carbon fiber/scba tank from their compressor. Another alternative is to contact a local paintball store, as paintballers use carbon fiber tanks to fill their markers.  If the only alternative you have is to fill your high-pressure carbon fiber scba tank at a dive shop, a 1/8&quot; BSPP male to DIN female adapter (our part # AA-Z2128-300) can temporarily replace the hose on the valve adapter so the dive shop can fill your tank.`;pyr/Carbon-Fiber-Tank-4500-psi-88-cu-ft_AV-4500HPT.jpg;pyr/Carbon-Fiber-Tank-4500-psi-88-cu-ft_AV-4500HPT.jpg;pyr/Carbon-Fiber-Tank-4500-psi-88-cu-ft_AV-4500HPT.jpg;2.41;;;0;662.99;735.92;39.19;47.83;2;822.94;971.07;pyrsm/Carbon-Fiber-Tank-4500-psi-88-cu-ft_AV-4500HPT_sm.jpg;PRECHARGED GUN ACCESSORIES;39

The Quiet Pellet Trap ends that problem forever, because it's loaded with 10 lbs. of ballistic putty that captures and holds your ammo. It's great for outdoor use, too! The trap is suited to guns that produce less than 18 foot-pounds of energy at 10 meters.  If you notice your ammo popping out of the trap, then it's time to remove the pellets and BBs stuck in the putty. But, that won't happen until you've shot a LOT of rounds.  The frame of the trap is made of walnut-stained pine. It's 13.5&quot;Hx12.5&quot;W. There's a groove that accepts a target, such as the <a href=&quot;http://www.pyramydair.com/s/a/National_Target_Air_Rifle_Target_12_Bullseye_100_ct/3539&quot;>NRA official 10-meter 12-bull air rifle target</a>.

Of course, if you want to, you can remove it easily and attach another one. Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.  Most dot sights have Weaver mounts. If you choose one of them, remember to pick up AirForce's 11mm-to-Weaver adapter listed in the accessories link.  The AirForce TalonP PCP pistol is heavier than most air pistols and cannot be comfortably held the way most pistols are held and still result in reliable, repeatable accuracy. A comfortable hold is with one hand on the pistol grip and the other holding the top of the scope. If you assume a sitting position, you can hold the grip with one hand and rest the gun's forearm on your off hand's forearm. These two positions will draw the pistol much closer to your eye, and you can mount a rifle scope on the TalonP air pistol. A pistol scope could also be mounted, but there are more choices among rifle scopes.`;pyr/U208_PY-2400.jpg;pyr/U208_PY-2400.jpg;pyr/U208_PY-2400.jpg;1.24;0.25;900;100;346.8;384.95;20.5;25.02;2;430.47;507.95;pyrsm/U208_PY-2400_sm.jpg;AIR PISTOLS;11

Thanks to the new Spin-Loc tank and collar, you don't have to remove the gun's air reservoir to fill it. Of course, if you want to, you can remove it easily and attach another one. Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.  Not sure which caliber to get? Get all of them! Extra barrels are available, and change-outs are quick and easy and don't require any special tools.  The Talon SS is the same basic rifle as the Talon, but an integral suppressor and a 12&quot; barrel are standard. The shorter barrel makes it slightly lighter than the Talon, and the integral suppressor seriously reduces the report.  <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air.

Up to 1000 fps (in .177). Accuracy! 1&quot; at 50 yards. NO recoil! Built in the USA, the Talon SS pre-charged pneumatic air rifle is for serious shooting. Field target, hunting, punching paper targets, shooting spinners and plinking are all perfect for the Talon SS...because it does everything so well!

Choose the Talon SS with a blue anodized frame.  <strong><font color=red>Equipped with the new Sound-Loc suppressor!</font></strong>  Power! Up to 1000 fps (in .177). Accuracy! 1&quot; at 50 yards. NO recoil! Built in the USA, the Talon SS pre-charged pneumatic air rifle is for serious shooting. Field target, hunting, punching paper targets, shooting spinners and plinking are all perfect for the Talon SS...because it does everything so well! The easy-to-use power-adjust wheel takes your rifle from 400 fps to 1000 fps. You decide how much power you want and when you want it. If you're shooting field target...dial it down. Hunting...dial it up.  From its Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist) to its removable air tank, the Talon SS is the standard for state-of-the-art manufacturing of pre-charged pneumatics. Made of space-age polymers and aircraft-grade aluminum, the AirForce Talon SS is lightweight and equipped with a durable finish.   The removable 490cc air tank (DOT-certified) can be filled with a hand pump, scuba tank or electric compressor to 3000 psi (206 bar) for lots of shots without a refill. The tank does double-duty as the butt of the gun, contributing to its light weight and convenience. The tank has a pressure-release valve for additional safety.  Thanks to the new Spin-Loc tank and collar, you don't have to remove the gun's air reservoir to fill it. Of course, if you want to, you can remove it easily and attach another one. Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.  Not sure which caliber to get? Get all of them! Extra barrels are available, and change-outs are quick and easy and don't require any special tools.  The Talon SS is the same basic rifle as the Talon, but an integral suppressor and a 12&quot; barrel are standard. The shorter barrel makes it slightly lighter than the Talon, and the integral suppressor seriously reduces the report.  There are lots of ways to configure this gun, including rail-mounted accessories (coin-slot screws for each changeout). You can choose the laser, flashlight, night vision equipment, extra tanks, quick-detach fiber-optic sights and attachments for the type of refilling unit you plan to use. If you replace the barrel with a longer one, the gun will not be silenced.  <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air.

Choose the Talon SS with a blue anodized frame.  <strong><font color=red>Equipped with the new Sound-Loc suppressor!</font></strong>  Power! Up to 1000 fps (in .177). Accuracy! 1&quot; at 50 yards. NO recoil! Built in the USA, the Talon SS pre-charged pneumatic air rifle is for serious shooting. Field target, hunting, punching paper targets, shooting spinners and plinking are all perfect for the Talon SS...because it does everything so well! The easy-to-use power-adjust wheel takes your rifle from 400 fps to 1000 fps. You decide how much power you want and when you want it. If you're shooting field target...dial it down. Hunting...dial it up.  From its Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist) to its removable air tank, the Talon SS is the standard for state-of-the-art manufacturing of pre-charged pneumatics. Made of space-age polymers and aircraft-grade aluminum, the AirForce Talon SS is lightweight and equipped with a durable finish.   The removable 490cc air tank (DOT-certified) can be filled with a hand pump, scuba tank or electric compressor to 3000 psi (206 bar) for lots of shots without a refill. The tank does double-duty as the butt of the gun, contributing to its light weight and convenience. The tank has a pressure-release valve for additional safety.  Thanks to the new Spin-Loc tank and collar, you don't have to remove the gun's air reservoir to fill it. Of course, if you want to, you can remove it easily and attach another one. Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.  Not sure which caliber to get? Get all of them! Extra barrels are available, and change-outs are quick and easy and don't require any special tools.  The Talon SS is the same basic rifle as the Talon, but an integral suppressor and a 12&quot; barrel are standard. The shorter barrel makes it slightly lighter than the Talon, and the integral suppressor seriously reduces the report.  There are lots of ways to configure this gun, including rail-mounted accessories (coin-slot screws for each changeout). You can choose the laser, flashlight, night vision equipment, extra tanks, quick-detach fiber-optic sights and attachments for the type of refilling unit you plan to use. If you replace the barrel with a longer one, the gun will not be silenced.  <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air. The type of adapter depends on how you plan to fill your gun. A scuba tank will require a different adapter than a hand pump or carbon fiber tank.

395;PY-3071;0;1;1;0;1;AirForce Talon SS, Red Precharged Pneumatic Rifle;AirForce;9;`For those of you who want the look, feel and power of a black rifle...but with color! Choose the Talon SS with a red anodized frame.  Power! Up to 1000 fps (in .177). Accuracy! 1&quot; at 50 yards. NO recoil! Built in the USA, the Talon SS pre-charged pneumatic air rifle is for serious shooting. Field target, hunting, punching paper targets, shooting spinners and plinking are all perfect for the Talon SS...because it does everything so well! The easy-to-use power-adjust wheel takes your rifle from 400 fps to 1000 fps. You decide how much power you want and when you want it. If you're shooting field target...dial it down. Hunting...dial it up.  From its Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist) to its removable air tank, the Talon SS is the standard for state-of-the-art manufacturing of pre-charged pneumatics. Made of space-age polymers and aircraft-grade aluminum, the AirForce Talon SS is lightweight and equipped with a durable finish.   The removable 490cc air tank (DOT-certified) can be filled with a hand pump, scuba tank or electric compressor to 3000 psi (206 bar) for lots of shots without a refill. The tank does double-duty as the butt of the gun, contributing to its light weight and convenience. The tank has a pressure-release valve for additional safety.  Not sure which caliber to get? Get all of them! Extra barrels are available, and change-outs are quick and easy and don't require any special tools.  The Talon SS is the same basic rifle as the Talon, but an integral suppressor and a 12&quot; barrel are standard. The shorter barrel makes it slightly lighter than the Talon, and the integral suppressor seriously reduces the report.  There are lots of ways to configure this gun, including rail-mounted accessories (coin-slot screws for each changeout). You can choose the laser, flashlight, night vision equipment, extra tanks, quick-detach fiber-optic sights and attachments for the type of refilling unit you plan to use. If you replace the barrel with a longer one, the gun will not be silenced.  <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air. The type of adapter depends on how you plan to fill your gun. A scuba tank will require a different adapter than a hand pump or carbon fiber tank.

Accurate (1&quot; at 50 yards) and powerful, this PCP offers extreme flexibility. It has a 24&quot; Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist). You can also buy 12&quot; and 18&quot; barrels. Change-outs are easy and don't require any special tools. Built in the USA.  <font color=red>NOTE:</font> The .20 cal. pellets are slightly longer than the .22 cal. pellets of the same weight. Therefore, they drag in the barrel a little more and produce lower velocities. The quoted figures (showing the .20 cal. gun shooting slower than the .22 cal. gun) are actual test figures and are correct.  <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air.

The Beeman Devastator pellet's patented design has a hollow head and a projecting point coming out of it. Around the edge of the hollowpoint are nicks.  On impact, these nicks create an extreme mushrooming effect that forces the point to project even further. Unique but also amazingly effective! Having the qualities of both a hollowpoint and a pointed pellet, this lead projectile will prove highly effective for hunters and pest eliminators. The mushrooming hollowpoint is the first hit, but the extra penetration of the point is like a second hit on the same quarry.  The world's only partitioned hollowpoint pellet!;pyr/Beeman-Devastator-177cal_BN-52177_pellet_lg.jpg;pyr/Beeman-Devastator-177cal_BN-52177_pellet_lg.jpg;pyr/Beeman-Devastator-177cal_BN-52177_pellet_lg.jpg;0.15;0.177;;100;6.43;7.14;0.38;0.46;2;7.98;9.42;pyrsm/Beeman-Devastator-177cal_BN-52177_sm.jpg;AMMO;20

Connect the Foster fitting on the end of the hose to the air reservoir on the rifle.   To exhaust air or CO2 from the rifle, you need to purchase the degasser tool.</font>  Get into precharged guns at an unheard-of price and also get the accuracy of an expensive European rifle!  Benjamin has bridged the gap and taken the pain out of PCP guns. Not only is this as low a price as you'll ever find on a PCP/hand pump combo, but it's so easy to pump up that a wispy teenager could do it!  If you prefer to use a scuba tank instead of the hand pump, you'll need a scuba tank adapter with hose and a female quick-disconnect with male threads. The last item already comes with this kit. The adapter fits tanks with a K valve. The air reservoir has a male Foster fitting.   The Discovery has raised the bar for PCP guns because it uses only 2000 psi of air. While the European companies race toward higher and higher air pressures, Benjamin is going the opposite direction and making it easier than ever to use a hand pump. If you want to use a scuba tank or carbon fiber tank, you can do that, too, and get the benefit of many more fills than you would from a gun that operates with 3000 psi. The Discovery gives you a choice! The air reservoir is 135cc.  The gun comes with a hardwood stock (14&quot; length of pull), Williams fiber optic front and rear sights, and a built-in air pressure gauge. Included in the package is a hand pump that's easy to use and very clear on showing you when you've reached maximum operating pressure.  When you open your box, you'll see easy-to-follow and easy-to-understand instructions that'll lead you step-by-step. If you're an experienced PCP user, you'll soon see that the Discovery is the easiest PCP you've ever used. If you're new to PCPs, you'll become a pro in just a few short steps.  If you want to switch to CO2, that's easy to do. A degasser tool lets you quickly and safely exhaust all the high-pressure air (or you can just shoot the air out). Attach the optional CO2 adapter, connect it to a standard paintball CO2 tank and fill 'er up! Now, commence to shootin'!  With high-pressure air, you'll get up to 25 powerful shots before you need to pump up again. On CO2, you'll get a lot more shots per fill.  The Discovery is made in America.`;pyr/BJ-BP1K77GP_lg.jpg;pyr/BJ-BP1K77GP_lg.jpg;pyr/BJ-BP1K77GP_lg.jpg;2.47;0.177;1000;100;382.49;424.56;22.61;27.6;2;474.77;560.23;pyrsm/BJ-BP1K77GP_sm.jpg;AIR RIFLES;12

Air guns don't require as much cleaning as firearms, but sometimes you have to clean the barrel due to preservative grease used by the manufacturer or if you use pellets that foul the bore with copper or lead. Then, you need to use solvents/cleaners that are aggressive enough to remove the debris/grease but not so harsh that they'll damage the bore. Same goes for brushes. That's why we recommend these nylon bristle brushes from Brownells.`;pyr/Brownell-22-Pistol-Nylon-Bore-Brush-3pk-8-32-thread-2-1-8-long_BR-084420121.jpg;pyr/Brownell-22-Pistol-Nylon-Bore-Brush-3pk-8-32-thread-2-1-8-long_BR-084420121.jpg;pyr/Brownell-22-Pistol-Nylon-Bore-Brush-3pk-8-32-thread-2-1-8-long_BR-084420121.jpg;0.11;;;100;6.07;6.74;0.36;0.44;2;7.53;8.89;pyrsm/Brownell-22-Pistol-Nylon-Bore-Brush-3pk-8-32-thread-2-1-8-long_BR-084420121_sm.jpg;MAINTENANCE AND CLEANING;35

This pistol is suitable for plinking, popping paper targets, hitting spinners and killing tin cans.  This pistol comes with a blade front sight and a fully adjustable rear. You can mount a pistol scope or a red dot on it, but you'll need the 459MT intermount. The plastic grip and pump handle are checkered to give you a firm grip. There's even a thumbrest on the grip.

1226;PY-2215;0;1;1;0;1;Crosman 760X Pumpmaster Combo;Crosman;46;The Crosman 760 Pumpmaster is what all the other multi-pump pneumatics want to be! In production for decades, over 10 million have been sold. It shoots BBs or .177 pellets and does so with power and accuracy.   At less than 3 lbs., it's a great starter air rifle. The stock and forearm are made of a durable synthetic that takes lots of use and still looks good. An economical rifle, the Pumpmaster takes 3 to 10 pumps to send BBs up to 625 fps and pellets up to 600 fps. The checkering on the grip and the indentations on the pump handle make it that much easier to get a grip and stay on target.  Ideal for plinking and target shooting. (Never shoot BBs at water or hard objects!) It's so light that you can shoot all day! Suitable for younger shooters (with adult supervision) and smaller adults.  Pellets are loaded into a 5-shot clip, while BBs have an 18-shot magazine, which is fed from the 200-shot reservoir. Includes a 4x15 scope, fixed front sight and adjustable metal rear sight.;pyr/Crosman-Pumpmaster-760X-Scope_CR760X_lg.jpg;pyr/Crosman-Pumpmaster-760X-Scope_CR760X_lg.jpg;pyr/Crosman-Pumpmaster-760X-Scope_CR760X_lg.jpg;1.3;0.177;625;100;40.55;45.01;2.4;2.93;2;50.33;59.39;pyrsm/Crosman-Pumpmaster-760X-Scope_CR760X_sm.jpg;AIR RIFLES;12

1465;PY-1734;0;1;1;0;1;IMI Jericho 941F CO2 Pistol, Semi-Auto;Cybergun;47;The Jericho 941 was designed by IMI (Israel Military Industries) and has been on the market since 1990. At first it used .41 caliber munitions, but this caliber did not find acceptance in the marketplace. The Jericho was then offered in 9 mm, .40 S&W and .45ACP.  The Cybergun replica is an airsoft CO2 model with locked breech. The advantage of this technology is that the gas serves only to propel the pellet, making possible a velocity at the mouth of the barrel of 100 m/s (1 joule) with a 0.20-gram BBs. This power is very well directed by a BAX trajectory correction system. The release is smooth and gradual. Taking aim is assisted by the two white points located on the backsight. The magazine has a 15-rd capacity and accommodates the CO2 cartridge. One cartridge lets you fire more than 200 airsoft BBs. This is exceptional performance for a gas gun.;pyr/IMI_CG150300.jpg;pyr/IMI_CG150300.jpg;pyr/IMI_CG150300.jpg;0.85;0.24;425;100;23.87;26.5;1.41;1.72;2;29.63;34.96;pyrsm/IMI_CG150300_sm.jpg;AIRSOFT GUNS;17
1466;PY-1735;0;1;1;0;1;SIG Sauer GSR CO2 w/Metal Slide Pistol;Cybergun;47;The American subsidiary of SIG SAUER, SIG Arms, took charge of the development of the GSR. In 2003, the demand for .45 ACP hand guns was such that many manufacturers were commercializing replicas of the Colt 1911.<br /><br />  The replica designed by Cybergun is a CO2 'Gas Gun' with locked breech that generates a power of 1 joule. The breech is made entirely of metal and the markings have been engraved by laser, all of which gives a very realistic effect.<br /><br />  The magazine is of the 'Slim' type, meaning that it is no bigger than the hand grip. It has a 15 pellet capacity. The very first CO2 replicas had a very long magazine, which detracted from the realism of the Soft Air. The technical team at Cybergun succeeded in reducing the size of the magazine so that it remains within the proportions of the genuine magazine.<br /><br />  The presence of a Picatinny type rail below the barrel allows you to customize your replica with a flashlight or laser spotter.;pyr/SIG_CG280302.jpg;pyr/SIG_CG280302.jpg;pyr/SIG_CG280302.jpg;0.57;0.24;425;100;42.32;46.98;2.5;3.05;2;52.53;61.99;pyrsm/SIG_CG280302_sm.jpg;AIRSOFT GUNS;17
1467;PY-1771;0;1;1;0;1;Colt Delta Elite Airsoft Spring Pistol;Cybergun;47;`The Colt Delta Elite is a great second chance gun. It is part of the HPA Series, Heavy Powerful Accurate Series. This is a realistic replica.   The Colt Delta Elite uses a Hop-Up system. The &quot;Hop-Up&quot; system creates friction on the BB as it is shot through the barrel. This puts a spin on the BB that helps it to fight gravity, wind resistance, and air friction allowing it to be shot farther.  This is a Spring Airsoft Pistol, which means it's powered by a spring and must be cocked for each shot. It's fast, clean, inexpensive and easily maintained; it requires no gas or batteries to operate.

1476;PY-1918;0;1;1;0;1;Kalashnikov AK47  Premium AEG Blowback;Cybergun;47;M.T. Kalashnikov entered the Red Army in Kiev 1938 where he attended tank mechanics school. In the army, he designed a device to count the number of shots fired by a tank as well as other useful tactical devices for tanks. After surviving fierce battles against the Nazi's in 1941 as a tank commander, he found himself in hospital recovering from serious wounds and battle fatigue. Here at the hospital he began to conceive ideas for a new machine gun which could provide high volume, light weight firepower for soldiers in mechanized infantry. While on temporary medical duty, stationed at Matai, he took advantage of the workshop facilities to prototype his weapon. In 1944 his first prototype was adopted for further development and finally in 1949 the soviet army adopted the Automatic Kalashnikov design of 1947 as their standard rifle. As of 1990, more than 70 million Kalashnikov automatic rifles of various designs had been produced. M.T. Kalashnikov was a self taught inventor.

1744;PY-A-4441;0;1;1;0;1;Ecotarget Ice Target Mold, 2 Target Sizes;Ecotarget;59;` Ice target mold 2 target sizes (5 are 3&quot;Wx4&quot;H and 4 are 1.5&quot;Wx2&quot;H) Fill mold with water, freeze, pop out targets and shoot Shot targets produce an exciting shattering effect Environmentally friendly No cleanup or dangerous residue that could injure people, pets or wildlife Cheap to make User-adjustable for thickness and color Use with pellet guns or firearms (never shoot steel BBs at these...they'll ricochet) Made in USA   If you can turn on a faucet, you can make your own reactive targets. No technology, no special skills, no mess. ALWAYS wear safety glasses and remove all pets from the area as the targets will shatter in all directions.  DIRECTIONS:  Place empty mold in freezer Fill cavities with water (soda bottle works well) For 1/4&quot; thickness, fill to witness mark found at apex of each target For 3/8&quot; thickness, fill to the top of the cavity To remove targets from mold, remove mold from freezer & let rest on counter for 3-4 minutes at room temp To unmold, hold mold upside down over a towel and gently twist at opposite corners Store unmolded targets in freezer til you're ready to shoot   If you want to enhance your targets, add some food coloring. That also makes them easier to see. Get more than one mold and stack filled molds in your freezer. Fill and leave them in the freezer until you're ready to use them. That way, you'll always have some available whenever the mood strikes you to shoot.  In warmer weather, your ice targets may melt faster than you like. Inhibit fast melting by making pykrete, which is a mixture of 14% sawdust and 86% water (by weight...frozen). They'll last longer than dry ice but won't shatter as well as plain ice targets.`;pyr/EcoTarget-ICE-Target-mold_ECO-H2001.jpg;pyr/EcoTarget-ICE-Target-mold_ECO-H2001.jpg;pyr/EcoTarget-ICE-Target-mold_ECO-H2001.jpg;0.62;;;100;7.04;7.81;0.42;0.51;2;8.74;10.31;pyrsm/EcoTarget-ICE-Target-mold_ECO-H2001_sm.jpg;TARGETS, PELLET AND BB TRAPS, RANGES;47

This precharged pneumatic (PCP) has two built-in chambers (290cc total) that hold high-pressure air (3,000 psi) from a scuba tank, hand pump or compressor.  It has a two-stage adjustable trigger. The sights are pretty unique, in that both the front and rear are adjustable. The front post can be adjusted for elevation by turning a small wheel under the post. The rear is a two-hole aperture that flips from a small to large hole and is adjustable for windage.  Accuracy is the name of the game when it comes to shooting, and the Sumatra 2500 excels in that area: 3/8&quot; ctc at 30 yds. with Eun Jin pellets.

The cylinder makes it easy to use longer pellets and even mix-and-match different pellet lengths and types.  The adjustable power wheel has 13 settings, making this one of the most versatile powerhouses on the market! You'll get about 11 shots on high power and 18 on medium.

For many decades, Feinwerkbau has been a top-tier manufacturer for champion shooters. This magnificent air rifle is not just ergonomic, but it has many ways that you can fine-tune the stock to customize it to your shooting needs. But even if you have a gun that's made just for you, it won't make any difference if it doesn't deliver pinpoint accuracy.  When it comes to groups, yours will be so tight that it'll look like you shot just one pellet with each pull of the trigger. The FWB 700 delivers a 0.04&quot; group (center-to-center). Yes, they'll all go through the same hole...if you do your part.  Because this rifle is powered by high-pressure air, the cocking lever requires an easy 2 lbs. of effort. The dry-fire capability lets you safely and repeatedly fire the gun to hone your shooting skills...especially useful for competitors.  The FWB 700 is infinitely adjustable. The butt can be adjusted in almost every direction, and the raised cheekpiece adjusts up and down--up to 30mm--and cants top to bottom or vice versa--up to 20 degrees. Plus, the cheekpiece can be canted left to right by 15 degrees, and the entire unit can be moved 5mm left or right.  There's a 25&quot; shroud that covers the 16.73&quot; barrel.

You can adjust just about every part of the trigger, including pull-off point, initial travel, finger length, lateral position and trigger slack weight.

This Gamo scope has an etched-glass reticle, which is superior to a wire reticle because it's etched by a laser and is much more precise. That lets you get even more accuracy from your gun. Another way that etched-glass reticles are superior to wire reticles is when they're illuminated. The etched ones show the illumination only on the reticle. It looks like the reticle is floating.

2558;PY-1061;0;1;1;0;1;HFC M190 Combo Metal Semi Auto Pistol Rail Ver.;HFC;87;An exact replica in terms of design and function of the Marui M9, this M92 from HFC is a bargain. HFC improved the Marui design with an enlarged and ported gas valve, thereby delivering 20fps more than the Marui Tactical Master / M9. High quality finishing with nickel plated barrel and rubberized grips make this an extremely attractive pistol. Internal mechanism exactly the same as Tokyo Marui's which means that upgrade potential is identical and can use Marui parts. This pistol can even use Marui's standard M9 magazines. Power right out of the box is impressive using TOP GAS / GREEN GAS at 310fps Strong power and recoil. Excellent value for money given the feel and performance!  The HFC M190 is completely metal and only weighs a few ounces less than the real M92. The only visible plastic part on the outside of the gun is the grip. Metal parts included: slide, barrel, magazine, frame, recoil spring guide, hammer, safety, slide stop, rear sight, trigger, magazine catch. It comes with a built on rail for mounting accessories.

They all come from the same plant and are manufactured to the same specs. The guns are identical.  Includes Drozd BB pistol, 20-oz. bulk-fill CO2 tank and hose. The Drozd is made in Russia by IZH-Baikal. This one has been specially modified with a refillable 20-oz. CO2 tank that will shoot about 1,300 shots before you have to refill it!) Spend less time (and money) on small CO2 cartridges and more time shooting. If you want to convert back to 12-gram CO2 cartridges, you can easily do that! <font color=red>As shown in the picture, the CO2 gas flows from the tank into an adapter housed in the grip. That adapter is the same size and shape as a standard 12-gram CO2 cartridge.</font>  There are three switches to operate the unique select-fire mechanism. The first one turns on the gun. The second one selects the firing mode: semi-auto (one shot with each pull of the trigger), three-round burst (full-auto) or six-round burst (full-auto). The third switch controls the burst rate: 300 rounds per minute, 450 rounds per minute or 600 rounds per minute.  The gun comes with a detachable shoulder stock (increases length by 5.75&quot; but cannot be used with 20-oz. tank), scope rail, sights, one 30-round magazine and a BB loader.

Want the suppressor look and feel for your Drozd BB gun without the expense, hassle and government oversight? Our .22LR fake suppressor is as close to a real suppressor as you can get without paying the tax stamp.  It's CNC-machined from a solid aluminum rod, given a durable liquid ceramic finish and professionally laser-engraved. Everything is identical to the real ATF-registered suppressors!   Since its a fake suppressor, the gun's report (loudness) is NOT reduced. Many shooters prefer the weight and balance improvement with the added suppressor. In fact, it'll work on any airgun that has a 1/2&quot;x28 TPI threaded barrel.  To ensure exact thread alignment, the threaded adapters are CNC-machined to precision tolerances from a solid steel rod in one lathe operation. They are hot-salt blued to match the gun. The included steel thread protector covers the threads on your barrel when no accessory is mounted. Easy installation in place of the existing barrel nut. No tools or modifications are required.`;pyr/Drozd_Suppressor_1972.jpg;pyr/Drozd_Suppressor_1972.jpg;pyr/Drozd_Suppressor_1972.jpg;0.2;;;100;38.21;42.41;2.26;2.76;2;47.43;55.97;pyrsm/Drozd_Suppressor_1972_sm.jpg;SHOOTING NEEDS AND ACCESSORIES;42

Large High Capacity Wind-up Airsoft Magazine.High Capacity magazines have a loading door on the top. Simply pour in BBs until the compartment is full. On most magazines you should put at least 100 BBs in the magazine before you initially start to wind it or it will not be able to feed correctly. To wind the magazine turn the wheel on the bottom of the magazine. As you wind the magazine it will make a ticking noise. You will notice that BBs will feed up into the top of the magazine and are visible at the top. Keep winding until the ticking changes to a louder clicking noise which means the magazine is fully wound. Sometimes it is better to wind the magazine after you put it in the gun. If the BB release is bumped while you are putting the magazine into the gun the BBs can spray out and you will have to start all over again.;pyr/LEMAG-M87L.jpg;pyr/LEMAG-M87L.jpg;pyr/LEMAG-M87L.jpg;0.43;;;100;6.43;7.14;0.38;0.46;2;7.98;9.42;pyrsm/LEMAG-M87Ls.jpg;AIRSOFT MAGAZINES/CLIPS;18

If you're hunting and your quarry is hidden among greenery, use a contrasting color to see all the points on your lit mil-dot reticle.  The 30mm tube lets in a lot of light, and the emerald-coated lenses offer the most amount of light compared to other types of coatings.

The etched ones show the illumination only on the reticle. It looks like the reticle is floating.

The NightHawk is ideal for plinking, target shooting, hitting spinners, pistol competition or practicing for firearm proficiency. It's everything you want it to be...and more!;pyr/Walther-Nighthawk_Walther-2252204_pistol_lg.jpg;pyr/Walther-Nighthawk_Walther-2252204_pistol_lg.jpg;pyr/Walther-Nighthawk_Walther-2252204_pistol_lg.jpg;1.3;0.177;400;100;188.59;209.33;11.15;13.61;2;234.09;276.22;pyrsm/Walther-Nighthawk_Walther-2252204_pistol_sm.jpg;AIR PISTOLS;11
