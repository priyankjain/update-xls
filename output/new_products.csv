By floating the action on rails, RWS takes the rifle's powerful recoil and significantly reduces the amount you feel. It also enhances accuracy, because the pellet exits the barrel before spring vibration is transmitted to it.  Our .177-cal. RWS 54 Air King has the TO5 trigger. The .22-cal. model has the TO6 trigger.

`PY-463`;`Sumatra 2500 Carbine`;`Eun Jin`;`Devastating, authoritative knockdown power! The Sumatra 2500 is an easy-to-cock, lever-action repeater. This precharged pneumatic (PCP) has two built-in chambers (290cc total) that hold high-pressure air (3,000 psi) from a scuba tank, hand pump or compressor.  It has a two-stage adjustable trigger. The sights are pretty unique, in that both the front and rear are adjustable. The front post can be adjusted for elevation by turning a small wheel under the post. The rear is a two-hole aperture that flips from a small to large hole and is adjustable for windage.  Accuracy is the name of the game when it comes to shooting, and the Sumatra 2500 excels in that area: 3/8&quot; ctc at 30 yds. with Eun Jin pellets. To get the most from this airgun, you'll want to mount a scope on the 11mm dovetails. The finely rifled (and 10x1mm threaded) steel barrel (1:18 RH twist) is fed by a 6-shot cylinder that makes for quick follow-up shots. The cylinder makes it easy to use longer pellets and even mix-and-match different pellet lengths and types.  The adjustable power wheel has 13 settings, making this one of the most versatile powerhouses on the market! You'll get about 11 shots on high power and 18 on medium.  Includes probe with 1/8&quot; BSPP male threads and 2 rotary clips.

It's great for metallic silhouettes, plinking, shooting spinners and paper targets, and accurate enough to do some serious hunting. If you're hunting game and eliminating pests, .20 or .22 caliber should be your choice.  The quality of the polishing and bluing on the steel action, barrel and underlever exceeds what you'd normally find on comparably priced firearms. The Monte Carlo stock has a raised cheekpiece, and the beech stock has hand-cut checkering on the pistol grip. The stock is capped with a soft rubber recoil pad to give you ultimate control.

Not only is this as low a price as you'll ever find on a PCP/hand pump combo, but it's so easy to pump up that a wispy teenager could do it!  If you prefer to use a scuba tank instead of the hand pump, you'll need a scuba tank adapter with hose and a female quick-disconnect with male threads. The last item already comes with this kit. The adapter fits tanks with a K valve. The air reservoir has a male Foster fitting.   The Discovery has raised the bar for PCP guns because it uses only 2000 psi of air. While the European companies race toward higher and higher air pressures, Benjamin is going the opposite direction and making it easier than ever to use a hand pump. If you want to use a scuba tank or carbon fiber tank, you can do that, too, and get the benefit of many more fills than you would from a gun that operates with 3000 psi. The Discovery gives you a choice! The air reservoir is 135cc.  The gun comes with a hardwood stock (14&quot; length of pull), Williams fiber optic front and rear sights, and a built-in air pressure gauge. Included in the package is a hand pump that's easy to use and very clear on showing you when you've reached maximum operating pressure.  When you open your box, you'll see easy-to-follow and easy-to-understand instructions that'll lead you step-by-step. If you're an experienced PCP user, you'll soon see that the Discovery is the easiest PCP you've ever used. If you're new to PCPs, you'll become a pro in just a few short steps.  If you want to switch to CO2, that's easy to do. A degasser tool lets you quickly and safely exhaust all the high-pressure air (or you can just shoot the air out). Attach the optional CO2 adapter, connect it to a standard paintball CO2 tank and fill 'er up! Now, commence to shootin'!  With high-pressure air, you'll get up to 25 powerful shots before you need to pump up again. On CO2, you'll get a lot more shots per fill.`;``;``;`http://www.pyramydair.com/images/BJ-BP1K77GP_lg.jpg`;`5.44`;`0.22`;`900.00`;`model`;``;`479.99`;`399.99`;``;``;``;`0.00`;`http://www.pyramydair.com/images/BJ-BP1K77GP_sm.jpg`;`AIR RIFLES`;`028478129696`;`false

`PY-1896`;`Beeman RX-2 Air Rifle, No Sights`;`Beeman`;`One of the more powerful guns in the Beeman line, the RX-2 isn't a traditional spring gun. Instead of a coiled steel spring, the piston is filled with air. It's like the gas spring that holds up the back door of a minivan or hatchback car. Instead of compressing a steel spring, you're compressing a column of air. You don't have to fill the gas spring because no air ever leaves it.  When you go hunting with a gun that has a gas spring, you never have to worry about the spring taking a &quot;set.&quot; When you cock a gun with a metal spring, you're supposed to shoot it right away. If you leave it cocked too long (and do that too many times), the spring loses strength, remains more compressed when it's uncocked and delivers lower power. That won't happen with a gas spring!  In any caliber, the RX-2 makes a great hunting rifle. In .22 cal., it delivers over 20 foot-pounds.  Includes 1&quot; scope rings, medium profile, vertical scope stop in one ring, 2 screws per base & 4 screws per ring cap.

Both front and rear sights are fiber optics.  It's a good idea to put 1 or 2 pumps into a multi-pump before you put it away for the day. Whether you're storing it til you shoot the next day or want to stowe it for 2 years, putting a couple pumps in the rifle keeps airborne dust and debris from deteriorating the seal.  Use Crosman Pellgunoil on the pump handle's hinge to keep it functioning properly for years.

Raised aluminum breech for easier loading of circular magazine 11mm dovetail (does not come with sights) Ambidextrous synthetic stock with vertically adjustable comb (almost a full pound lighter than the wood-stocked rifle!) Built-in air pressure gauge (manometer) 215cc air reservoir 7.30 lbs. 42.8&quot; long Air reservoir ends with a male quick-disconnect Foster fitting for fast refills (requires a female Foster quick-disconnect adapter to fill from a scuba tank or hand pump) Includes one magazine, sling swivel studs & degassing tool <strong><font color=red>Upgrades from the original version of the gun: Factory-installed depinger changes the sharp &quot;ping&quot; to a dull thud. Improved valve (increases the number of shots: .177/.22=32 shots, .25=16 shots). Trigger moved back for better hand position. Optional reversible bolt for left- or right-handed shooters. Simplified the breech design for assembly, service and to provide a more stable platform for larger scopes.</font></strong>   <strong>As the caliber increases, the gun becomes somewhat louder.</strong>`;``;``;`http://www.pyramydair.com/images/Benjamin-Marauder-PCP-Synthetic_BJ-BP1764S_lg.jpg`;`4.14`;`0.25`;`900.00`;`model`;``;`599.99`;`549.99`;``;``;``;`0.00`;`http://www.pyramydair.com/images/Benjamin-Marauder-PCP-Synthetic_BJ-BP1764S_sm.jpg`;`AIR RIFLES`;`028478140851`;`false

Built in the USA, the Talon pre-charged pneumatic AirForce PCP air rifle is for serious shooting. Field target, hunting, punching paper targets, shooting spinners and plinking are all perfect for the AirForce Talon PCP air rifle...because it does everything so well! The easy-to-use power-adjust wheel takes your rifle from 400 fps to 1100 fps. You decide how much power you want and when you want it. If you're shooting field target...dial it down. Hunting...dial it up.  From its Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist) to its removable air tank, the Talon is the standard for state-of-the-art manufacturing of pre-charged pneumatics. Made of space-age polymers and aircraft-grade aluminum, the AirForce Talon air rifle is lightweight and equipped with a durable finish.  The removable 490cc air tank (DOT-certified) can be filled with a hand pump, scuba tank or electric compressor to 3000 psi (206 bar) for lots of shots without a refill. The tank does double-duty as the butt of the AirForce air rifle, contributing to its light weight and convenience. The tank has a pressure-release valve for additional safety.  Thanks to the new Spin-Loc tank and collar, you don't have to remove the gun's air reservoir to fill it. Of course, if you want to, you can remove it easily and attach another one. Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.  Not sure which caliber to get? Get both! Extra barrels are available, and change-outs are quick and easy and don't require any special tools.   <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air.

Choose the Talon SS with a blue anodized frame.  <strong><font color=red>Equipped with the new Sound-Loc suppressor!</font></strong>  Power! Up to 1000 fps (in .177). Accuracy! 1&quot; at 50 yards. NO recoil! Built in the USA, the Talon SS pre-charged pneumatic air rifle is for serious shooting. Field target, hunting, punching paper targets, shooting spinners and plinking are all perfect for the Talon SS...because it does everything so well! The easy-to-use power-adjust wheel takes your rifle from 400 fps to 1000 fps. You decide how much power you want and when you want it. If you're shooting field target...dial it down. Hunting...dial it up.  From its Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist) to its removable air tank, the Talon SS is the standard for state-of-the-art manufacturing of pre-charged pneumatics. Made of space-age polymers and aircraft-grade aluminum, the AirForce Talon SS is lightweight and equipped with a durable finish.   The removable 490cc air tank (DOT-certified) can be filled with a hand pump, scuba tank or electric compressor to 3000 psi (206 bar) for lots of shots without a refill. The tank does double-duty as the butt of the gun, contributing to its light weight and convenience. The tank has a pressure-release valve for additional safety.  Thanks to the new Spin-Loc tank and collar, you don't have to remove the gun's air reservoir to fill it. Of course, if you want to, you can remove it easily and attach another one. Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.  Not sure which caliber to get? Get all of them! Extra barrels are available, and change-outs are quick and easy and don't require any special tools.  The Talon SS is the same basic rifle as the Talon, but an integral suppressor and a 12&quot; barrel are standard. The shorter barrel makes it slightly lighter than the Talon, and the integral suppressor seriously reduces the report.  There are lots of ways to configure this gun, including rail-mounted accessories (coin-slot screws for each changeout). You can choose the laser, flashlight, night vision equipment, extra tanks, quick-detach fiber-optic sights and attachments for the type of refilling unit you plan to use. If you replace the barrel with a longer one, the gun will not be silenced.  <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air.

Stop. Attach your pump or a scuba tank...or worse, go back to your home or car to fill up. Forget that!  The S510 TC carbine delivers twice as much air because it has twin reservoirs. Crank the power wheel up to max velocity and hunt without interruption, getting up to 35 shots. If you're just plinking or shooting at closer distances, turn the power wheel down low and get up to 100 shots before needing a refill.  If you're new to high-quality airguns, you may not know that Air Arms sets the standard for highly accurate air guns. They use Lothar Walther barrels, which are acknowledged by all of airgundom as makers of the most accurate sporting airgun barrels that money can buy. If you value being able to hit what you're aiming at, then get the S510 TC carbine.  Be prepared for the minute you open the box and see the S510 TC for the first time. Feel the smooth, high-quality stock and look at the lustrous finish. Examine the blued metal. Even if you spent twice as much, you won't find a gun with richer, deeper bluing.  British gunmakers have a rich history of superior gunmaking, stockwork and craftsmanship. When you buy an Air Arms gun, you're not buying JUST an airgun. You're buying an heirloom that will be passed down to your children...and to their children. You will never regret buying an Air Arms airgun!`;``;`S510 TC carbine.

They use Lothar Walther barrels, which are acknowledged by all of airgundom as makers of the most accurate sporting airgun barrels that money can buy. If you value being able to hit what you're aiming at, then get the S510 TC carbine.  Be prepared for the minute you open the box and see the S510 TC for the first time. Feel the smooth, high-quality stock and look at the lustrous finish. Examine the blued metal. Even if you spent twice as much, you won't find a gun with richer, deeper bluing.  British gunmakers have a rich history of superior gunmaking, stockwork and craftsmanship. When you buy an Air Arms gun, you're not buying JUST an airgun.

`PY-3063`;`AirForce Condor SS PCP Air Rifle, Spin-Loc Tank`;`AirForce`;`AirForce has kicked it up a notch with their new baffle system, which makes the Condor SS quieter.  The AirForce Condor delivers from 600 fps to a rip-snorting 1300 fps (in .177), and it's recoilless! Accurate (1&quot; at 50 yards) and powerful, this PCP offers extreme flexibility. It has an 18&quot; Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist). You can also buy 12&quot; and 24&quot; barrels. Change-outs are easy and don't require any special tools, but the gun will be unsilenced. Built in the USA.  <font color=red>NOTE:</font> The .20 cal. pellets are slightly longer than the .22 cal. pellets of the same weight. Therefore, they drag in the barrel a little more and produce lower velocities. The quoted figures (showing the .20 cal. gun shooting slower than the .22 cal. gun) are actual test figures and are correct.  <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air. The type of adapter depends on how you plan to fill your gun. A scuba tank will require a different adapter than a hand pump or carbon fiber tank. If you use a hand pump, the type of adapter you need depends on the brand of hand pump you use.</font>  There are lots of ways to configure this gun, including rail-mounted accessories (coin-slot screws for each changeout). You can choose the scope, laser, flashlight, night vision equipment, extra tanks, quick-detach fiber-optic sights and attachments for the type of refilling unit you plan to use. If you replace the barrel with a longer one, the gun will not be silenced.  Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.  The .177-caliber Condor SS has a special tank valve spring. If you plan to attach other caliber barrels to your gun, you may want to buy a tank made for the other calibers (.20, ,22 & .25 calibers use the same tank). If you use the .177-calIber tank with the other smallbore calibers, you'll experience a drop of 50-100 fps in those calibers. However, if you buy the .20, .22 or .25 caliber but plan to also attach a .177-caliber barrel, you must buy a .177-caliber air tank. If you don't, the tank valve spring will not close fast enough, and all your air will be dumped.`;``;``;`http://www.pyramydair.com/images/AFU-Condor-SS-w-Spin-Lock-Tank_AFU2093.jpg`;`3.67`;`0.177`;`1300.00`;`model`;``;`737.00`;`700.00`;``;``;``;`0.00`;`http://www.pyramydair.com/images/AFU-Condor-SS-w-Spin-Lock-Tank_AFU2093_sm.jpg`;`AIR RIFLES`;``;`false

`PY-555`;`Beeman P1 Air Pistol`;`Beeman`;`Looks like a .45 1911 firearm...and just as accurate! Made in Germany by the legendary Weihrauch company, the Beeman P1 is considered by many to be the Holy Grail of air pistols. This is an heirloom airgun that you'll pass along to your grandchildren and beyond.  The gun's heft and balance convey quality and substance. It fills your hand without feeling bulky or oversized. The unusual overlever cocking mechanism compresses the powerful mainspring, and the hammer is actually the catch for it. Highly adjustable two-stage trigger, which has a serrated surface for more control, will help you extract maximum accuracy from the P1. In fact, the adjustable trigger is so crisp, you'll wish it was on your firearms.  The dovetail grooves are extra wide, and our accessory list has several 11mm to 14mm mounts that are known to fit.  Unlike many modern air pistols, the P1 isn't made of molded synthetics. It's a solid metal gun with finely checkered walnut grips. And, it's ambidextrous. The 11mm dovetails make it easy to mount a pistol scope or a red dot sight.  The P1 has two power levels. The different power levels are created by cocking the gun to different lock points. See the detail shots to see how to cock the gun for high power and low power.  The distance you shoot, the weight of the pellet and the type of target will let you determine which power level is best. The P1 is an excellent indoor trainer for those who shoot the M1911A1.`;``;``;`http://www.pyramydair.com/images/Beeman-P1-Iron-Sights_BN-22300_pistol_lg.jpg`;`1.81`;`0.22`;`460.00`;`model`;``;`529.95`;`459.95`;``;``;``;`0.00`;`http://www.pyramydair.com/images/Beeman-P1-Iron-Sights_BN-22300_pistol_sm.jpg`;`AIR PISTOLS`;``;`false

They all come from the same plant and are manufactured to the same specs. The guns are identical.  Includes Drozd BB pistol, 20-oz. bulk-fill CO2 tank and hose. The Drozd is made in Russia by IZH-Baikal. This one has been specially modified with a refillable 20-oz. CO2 tank that will shoot about 1,300 shots before you have to refill it!) Spend less time (and money) on small CO2 cartridges and more time shooting. If you want to convert back to 12-gram CO2 cartridges, you can easily do that! <font color=red>As shown in the picture, the CO2 gas flows from the tank into an adapter housed in the grip. That adapter is the same size and shape as a standard 12-gram CO2 cartridge.</font>  There are three switches to operate the unique select-fire mechanism. The first one turns on the gun. The second one selects the firing mode: semi-auto (one shot with each pull of the trigger), three-round burst (full-auto) or six-round burst (full-auto). The third switch controls the burst rate: 300 rounds per minute, 450 rounds per minute or 600 rounds per minute.  The gun comes with a detachable shoulder stock (increases length by 5.75&quot; but cannot be used with 20-oz. tank), scope rail, sights, one 30-round magazine and a BB loader. The magazine holds the ammo and the CO2 cartridge. This black Russian wonder is great as an all-day plinker. If you'd like to mount a pistol scope or red dot, that's easy enough with the 11mm dovetails.`;``;``;`http://www.pyramydair.com/images/BB-Bulk-CO2-1065_.jpg`;`2.27`;`0.177`;`541.00`;`model`;``;`400.00`;`329.99`;``;``;``;`0.00`;`http://www.pyramydair.com/images/BB-Bulk-CO2-1065_sm.jpg`;`AIR PISTOLS`;``;`false
