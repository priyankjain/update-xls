This gun isn't just for looks. It's a 10-shot repeater, with space in the rear stock to hold more clips that you can pre-load so you're always ready for more shots. (Gun comes with 1 clip; additional clips available) The air pressure gauge (manometer) always tells you how much air is left in the reservoir.
